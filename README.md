# Lucene cuVS

This is a project for using [cuVS](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs), NVIDIA's GPU accelerated vector search library, with [Apache Lucene](https://github.com/apache/lucene).

## Overview

This library provides a new [KnnVectorFormat](https://lucene.apache.org/core/10_3_1/core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/KnnVectorsFormat.html) which can be plugged into a Lucene codec.
